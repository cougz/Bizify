### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bizify.git
   cd Bizify
   ```

2. Start the application (first time):
   ```
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   This will build the containers, start the PostgreSQL database, backend API, and frontend services.

3. For subsequent starts:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000

### User Registration

When you first access the application, you'll need to:

1. Register a new account using the registration page
2. Set up your company information in the Settings page
3. Start adding customers and creating invoices

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Bizify consists of three main components:

1. **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores all application data
2. **Backend API**: Built with FastAPI (Python)
3. **Frontend**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/           # React frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server/           # FastAPI backend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker/           # Dockerfiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compose.yaml      # Docker Compose configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/           # Images for README and documentation
```

## üîß Configuration

### CORS Configuration

Bizify includes configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings to ensure secure communication between your frontend and backend. CORS is crucial for production deployments and can be customized based on your environment.

#### Environment Variables

Configure CORS using these environment variables:

- **`CORS_ORIGINS`**: Comma-separated list of allowed origins (default: `http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000`)
- **`CORS_METHODS`**: Allowed HTTP methods (default: `GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS`)
- **`CORS_HEADERS`**: Allowed request headers (default: `Content-Type,Authorization`)
- **`CORS_CREDENTIALS`**: Allow credentials in requests (default: `true`)

#### Quick Setup

1. **Development (default)**: No changes needed - works with localhost:3000
2. **Production**: Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Copy example configuration
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your production domains
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
   ```

#### Security Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never use `*` for origins in production** - always specify exact domains
- ‚úÖ **Use HTTPS** for production origins
- ‚úÖ **Test CORS configuration** after changes using the provided test script: `./test_cors.sh`

üìñ **For detailed CORS configuration guide, see [CORS_CONFIG.md](CORS_CONFIG.md)**

## üíª Development

### Backend Development

The backend is built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. The code is located in the `server` directory.

To run the backend separately for development:

```
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

### Frontend Development

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The code is located in the `client` directory.

To run the frontend separately for development:

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

## üö¢ Deployment

The application can be deployed using Docker Compose or Kubernetes:

### Docker Compose Deployment

1. **Configure environment variables for production**:
   ```bash
   # Create production environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your production settings
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
   CORS_CREDENTIALS=true
   ```

2. **Deploy with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

### Kubernetes Deployment

- Use the configuration files in the `k8s` directory
- Ensure CORS environment variables are properly configured in your deployment manifests

### Production CORS Checklist

- ‚úÖ Set specific domains in `CORS_ORIGINS` (no wildcards)
- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS origins only
- ‚úÖ Test CORS configuration with your frontend
- ‚úÖ Monitor CORS logs on application startup
